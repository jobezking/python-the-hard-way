    "## Scenario: Bug Squashing 101: Debugging Python Code\n",
    "\n",
    "You've just been hired as a data analyst at a renowned insect collection company. Your first task is to clean up their extensive insect database, which has unfortunately been plagued by some pesky data entry errors (and maybe a few actual bugs!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a series of interactive exercises, you'll learn how to identify and fix common data inconsistencies and errors using Python. You'll analyze error messages, strategically use print statements, and apply your Python skills to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the insect collection data. By the end of this activity, you'll be a bug-squashing champion, ready to tackle any messy dataset with confidence and precision!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Summary:\n",
    "You'll encounter and learn how to resolve common errors that can occur when working with data, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* FileNotFoundError: Troubleshoot issues related to missing or inaccessible data files, ensuring your scripts can locate and read the crucial insect collection records.\n",
    "\n",
    "* TypeError: Navigate through type-related errors, ensuring that you're performing operations on compatible data types (like numerical measurements and species names) and converting them when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "* IndexError: Master list indexing and avoid accessing insect records beyond their valid range, preventing unexpected crashes in your data cleaning scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* KeyError: Confidently work with insect data dictionaries, ensuring that you're accessing existing keys (like 'species' or 'leg count') and handling missing keys gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "* AttributeError: Understand the distinction between different data types and their available methods, avoiding attempts to use incompatible operations on insect data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ZeroDivisionError: Prevent division by zero errors by implementing checks and providing alternative solutions when encountering such scenarios, especially when calculating ratios or proportions based on insect attributes."

    "* Read the error message carefully: It often points directly to the problem.\n",
    "* Check file names and paths: Typos are common culprits.\n",
    "* Use print statements: Print the filename or path before trying to access it to confirm its correctness.\n",
    "* Verify file existence: Make sure the file is where you think it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Still Stuck?**\n",

    "Congratulations on completing your first task as a data analyst at the insect collection company! You've successfully applied your Python debugging skills to identify and resolve various errors, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the insect collection database. Let's recap what you've learned:\n",

    "* FileNotFoundError: You've learned how to troubleshoot issues related to missing or inaccessible data files, ensuring your scripts can locate and read the crucial insect collection records.\n",

    "\n",
    "* IndexError: You've mastered list indexing and learned how to avoid accessing insect records beyond their valid range, preventing unexpected crashes in your data cleaning scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* KeyError: You've gained confidence in working with insect data dictionaries, ensuring that you're accessing existing keys (like 'species' or 'leg count') and handling missing keys gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "* AttributeError: You now understand the distinction between different data types and their available methods, avoiding attempts to use incompatible operations on insect data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ZeroDivisionError: You've learned how to prevent division by zero errors by implementing checks and providing alternative solutions when encountering such scenarios, especially when calculating ratios or proportions based on insect attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Debugging is an essential part of programming. It's about systematically identifying and fixing errors in your code. Don't get discouraged if you encounter errors; it's a natural part of the learning process!"
