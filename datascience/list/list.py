#Scenario: You have a list of scores for students on an examination, and you'd like to calculate the average. 
# #You will need to calculate the total of the exam scores and then divide by the number of elements:
# 1. Start with a variable to store the total score
# 2. Loop through each score in the list (list comprehension)
# 3. Add the current score to the total score
# 4. Calculate the average score
# 5. Print the average score
